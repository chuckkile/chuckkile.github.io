										<p class="lead">"Patrick was a true partner… he accommodated us every step of the way- our family and daily schedules; changes of plans; any concerns and the challenges that are inevitable in such a large project. His only goal was that we be happy with the results. Three years later and the quality of workmanship is without question. It still looks and feels brand new! He created a home we will love for the next 30 years!"</p>

										<p class="lead">“From the first day I met Patrick Richardson and his talented crew, I knew I’d found the right remodeler for my project.  It had long been my desire to open up the stairway in my condo and create beautiful wood and carpet stairs with iron spindles.  And, I also wanted a built-in on an adjacent wall to house a wine refrigerator, storage and shelving—with the added complication that it needed to be designed around a large antique storage box with glass doors.   When Patrick, Chuck, and Dale put together the plan, bingo!  They knew what to do and how to do it.  The project was done efficiently, beautifully, and on time. Both the stairs and the built-in are pieces of art. I have to pinch myself every day that these smart, talented, and very, very nice people have given me the home of my dreams.”</p>

Patrick’s attention to detail kept us on track and his concern to keep our family life intact was obvious! We couldn’t be happier with the outcome. The subcontractors were equally as attentive and professional, arriving on time and completing their work as scheduled. We always came home to a clean house! We have recommended Murrayhill Remodeling to family and friends and will continue to do so with confidence!”</p>

I choose Murrayhill because Patrick Richardson promised me that he would do the right things the right way- and he honored his promise. I intend to continue using Murrayhill Remodeling in the future.”</p>

										<p class="lead">“We have had Murrayhill complete three major projects along with two minor jobs (at our home) over the last 12 years. Every job was done way above the expectations we had going in, all deadlines were hit on time, and the cost came in were he said they would unless we changed something during the job. One of the main reasons we like Patrick so much is how much detail he spends on everything he does. I have recommended Patrick to friends and family and they all have used Patrick and said he was the best. We would and have recommended Murrayhill Remodeling Co. to anyone.”</p>

									<div class="tab-content">
										<p>Murrayhill Remodeling was founded in 1997 by Patrick Richardson. One happy client turned into another and it quickly snowballed to where we are today, helping multiple clients a year turning their house into the home they want. As our company grows so do our capabilities. What started as a one man operation is now a growing team of people bringing top quality remodeling services to the Portland Area.

										<span>Purpose</span>
									</div>
									<div class="tab-content">
										<p>Believing that our true purpose on this planet is to realize our potential as humans our approach to each situation is to be all that we can be. We apply this to remodeling by striving to give the best service and produce the best end results surpassing industry standards and raising the bar for remodeling in Portland.

									<div class="tab-title">
										<span>Process</span>
									</div>
									<div class="tab-content">
										<p>
										It all starts with an idea. An idea is turned into a design plan and from there we start planning the execution. A specific schedule is made with a task for each day allowing everyone to know what is happening and when. Once construction is complete we stay in touch to make sure you are completely satisfied. Any issues are handled by us immediately. In the future we hope you are pleased with the experience and will recomend us to your friends.

									<div class="tab-title">
										<span>Method</span>
									</div>
									<div class="tab-content">
										<p>We prefer to work with interior designers and architects when projects meet a certain complexity threshold. This allows our customers to work with professionals whose job it is to bring designs to life on a screen. After design preferences are chosen and a plan is made, we bring those designs to life.
