										<p class="lead">"Patrick was a true partner… he accommodated us every step of the way- our family and daily schedules; changes of plans; any concerns and the challenges that are inevitable in such a large project. His only goal was that we be happy with the results. Three years later and the quality of workmanship is without question. It still looks and feels brand new! He created a home we will love for the next 30 years!"</p>

										<p class="lead">“From the first day I met Patrick Richardson and his talented crew, I knew I’d found the right remodeler for my project.  It had long been my desire to open up the stairway in my condo and create a built-in on an adjacent wall to house an entertainment center with the added complication that it needed to be designed around a large antique storage box with glass doors.   When Patrick, Chuck, and Dale put together the plan, bingo! The project was done efficiently, beautifully, and on time. I have to pinch myself every day that these smart, talented, and very nice people have given me the home of my dreams.”</p>

										<p class="lead">“From start to finish, we felt confident our goals were being met money-wise, schedule-wise and workmanship-wise. Patrick’s attention to detail kept us on track and his concern to keep our family life intact was obvious! We couldn’t be happier with the outcome. The subcontractors were equally as attentive and professional, arriving on time and completing their work as scheduled. We always came home to a clean house! We have recommended Murrayhill Remodeling to family and friends and will continue to do so with confidence!”</p>

										<p class="lead">“Over the past two years I’ve worked with Murrayhill Remodeling to update my home, including new windows and siding, completely remodeling the entryway, kitchen, TV room, den, carpeting and painting. I choose Murrayhill because Patrick Richardson promised me that he would do the right things the right way- and he honored his promise. I intend to continue using Murrayhill Remodeling in the future.”</p>

										<p class="lead">“We have had Murrayhill complete three major projects along with two minor jobs (at our home) over the last 12 years. Every job was done way above the expectations we had going in, all deadlines were hit on time, and the cost came in were he said they would unless we changed something during the job. One of the main reasons we like Patrick so much is how much detail he spends on everything he does. I have recommended Patrick to friends and family and they all have used Patrick and said he was the best. We would and have recommended Murrayhill Remodeling Co. to anyone.”</p>
